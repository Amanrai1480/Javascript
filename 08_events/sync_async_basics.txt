Javascript is a synchronous language(by default)
Synchronous:--
 means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.
Javascript is single threaded.
Execute one line of a code at a time.
Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing.

Asynchronous:--
Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI. Asynchronouscode execution code allows to Execute next instructions immediately and doesnt block the flow.

Blocking code     vs    Non-Blocking code
--------------         --------------------
block the flow of      doesnt block the 
 program.              execution
(read file sync)        (read file async)

**async await >> promise chains >> callback hell
-------------------------------------------------
these below are not core Javascript function, as they are window function in browser

1)setTimeout(handler,time)//hander is a callback without name
setTimeout(function(){
    console.log("hii");
},200)
setTimeout():--it Executes a function and we decide when to execute a function.
