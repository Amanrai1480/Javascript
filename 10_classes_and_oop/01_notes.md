# javascript and classes
## Does js really have classes ?
Yes, JavaScript does have classes. Classes were introduced in JavaScript with the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) specification, which was released in 2015. However it's important to note that js is primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype based inheritance mechanism.

"Syntactic sugar" refers to syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It doesn't add new functionality to the language but provides a more convenient or readable way to write code that could be written in a more complex or verbose way using the existing features of the language.
In other words, it provide a more familiar syntax for developers who coming from class based kanguage suvh as java, c++, but under the hood it works somewhat differently.
