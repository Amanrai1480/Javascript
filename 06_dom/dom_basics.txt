What is DOM?
DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface that represents structured documents like HTML and XML as a tree of objects. It defines how to access, manipulate, and modify document(HTML) elements using scripting languages like JavaScript.
When a web page loaded, the browser creates a DOM of the page.
we can access the complete code of html in js , as all the elementsof html are converted into object in DOM.
the document object present in window object.
Window object:It is a global object with lots of properties and methods. It is a browser's object and it is automatically created by the browser.


Why is DOM Required?
HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior to our web pages. When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the JavaScript can not understand the HTML document directly. So it interprets and interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), which is created by the browser based on the HTML document.

DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a tree-like structure composed of objects. JavaScript can not understand the tags(<h1>H</h1>) in HTML document but can understand object h1 in DOM.

JavaScript interprets DOM easily, using it as a bridge to access and manipulate the elements. DOM Javascript allow access to each of the objects (h1, p, etc) by using different functions.
Using DOM JavaScript we get access to HTML as well as CSS of the web page and can also modify the behavior of the HTML elements.
